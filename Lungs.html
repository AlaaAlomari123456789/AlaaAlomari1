  <h2>How Lungs Work</h2>
  <p>
    Lungs are part of the respiratory system, a group of organs and tissues that work together to help you breathe.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Importance -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Why Are Lungs Important?</h2>
  <p>
    Every cell in your body needs oxygen to live. The respiratory system moves fresh air into your body while removing waste gases. 
    Once in the lungs, oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is exhaled. This process is called <strong>gas exchange</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>Other important roles include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Warming and moisturizing air to the right humidity level</li>
    <li>Protecting your body by coughing, sneezing, filtering or swallowing harmful substances</li>
    <li>Supporting your sense of smell</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Parts of the Respiratory System -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>The Parts of the Respiratory System</h2>
  <h3>Airways</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sinuses:</strong> Hollow spaces that regulate air temperature and humidity.</li>
    <li><strong>Nose:</strong> Main entrance for air; filters dust and particles.</li>
    <li><strong>Mouth:</strong> Alternate entrance, especially during heavy exercise or blocked nasal passages.</li>
    <li><strong>Throat (pharynx):</strong> Collects incoming air and passes it to the windpipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Windpipe (trachea):</strong> Passage leading from throat to lungs.</li>
    <li><strong>Bronchial tubes:</strong> Divide into smaller bronchioles in the lungs.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Lungs and Blood Vessels -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Lungs and Blood Vessels</h2>
  <p>
    The right lung has three <strong>lobes</strong> and the left lung has two. The <strong>pleura</strong> is the protective membrane surrounding the lungs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cilia</strong> in the bronchial tubes move mucus upward to remove dust and germs. 
    The smallest branches (bronchioles) end in <strong>alveoli</strong>, where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged with the blood in <strong>capillaries</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Muscles and Bones -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Muscles and Bones</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>diaphragm</strong> is the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity and helps expand the lungs.  
    The <strong>ribs</strong> support and protect the chest cavity and move slightly during breathing.
  </p>

<!-- Keeping lungs healthy -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Keeping Lungs Healthy</h2>
  <p>
    Lung capacity declines with age. You can help keep your lungs healthy by eating a balanced diet, exercising, and managing stress.
