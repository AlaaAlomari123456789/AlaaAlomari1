        <!-- Pancreas Introduction -->
        <h2>The Pancreas and Its Functions</h2>
        <p>
            The pancreas is an organ located in the abdomen. It plays an essential role in converting the food we eat into fuel for the body's cells. 
            The pancreas has two main functions: an exocrine function that helps in digestion and an endocrine function that regulates blood sugar.
        </p>

        <!-- Location -->
        <h2>Location of the Pancreas</h2>
        <p>
            The pancreas is located behind the stomach in the upper left abdomen. It is surrounded by other organs including the small intestine, liver, and spleen. 
            It is spongy, about six to ten inches long, and is shaped like a flat pear or a fish extended horizontally across the abdomen.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several major blood vessels surround the pancreas, including the superior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, and celiac axis, supplying blood to the pancreas and other abdominal organs.

        <!-- Functions -->
        <h2>Functions of the Pancreas</h2>
        <p>
            A healthy pancreas produces the correct chemicals in the proper quantities, at the right times, to digest the foods we eat.
        </p>

        <h3>Exocrine Function</h3>
        <p>
            The pancreas contains exocrine glands that produce enzymes important to digestion. These include trypsin and chymotrypsin for proteins, amylase for carbohydrates, and lipase for fats. 
            Pancreatic juices are released into ducts that join the common bile duct, entering the duodenum to aid digestion.
        </p>

        <h3>Endocrine Function</h3>
        <p>
            The endocrine component consists of islet cells (islets of Langerhans) that release hormones like insulin (lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (raises blood sugar) directly into the bloodstream.
        </p>

        <!-- Diseases -->
        <h2>Diseases of the Pancreas</h2>
        <p>
            Disorders include pancreatitis, precancerous conditions like PanIN and IPMN, and pancreatic cancer.
        </p>

        <h3>Pancreatitis</h3>
        <p>
            Inflammation of the pancreas caused by enzyme buildup, which may digest the organ itself. Can be acute or chronic.
        </p>

        <h3>Precursors to Pancreatic Cancer</h3>
        <p>
            Risk factors: smoking, family history, hereditary syndromes, chronic pancreatitis, and lesions like IPMNs and PanINs.
        </p>

        <h3>Pancreatic Cancer</h3>
        <p>
            The most common form is pancreatic adenocarcinoma (exocrine tumor). Less than 5% are endocrine tumors (neuroendocrine or islet cell tumors).
