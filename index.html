<h1>The Human Body</h1><p>
Human beings are arguably the most complex organisms on this planet.
 Imagine billions of microscopic parts, each with its own identity,
 working together in an organized manner for the benefit of the total being.
 The human body is a single structure but it is made up of billions
 of smaller structures of four major kinds:


<strong>Cells</strong>

Cells have long been recognized as the simplest units of living matter 
that can maintain life and reproduce themselves. The human body, 
which is made up of numerous cells, begins as a single, newly fertilized cell.


<strong>Tissues</strong>

Tissues are somewhat more complex units than cells.
 By definition, a tissue is an organization of a great many similar 
 cells with varying amounts and kinds of nonliving, intercellular substance between them.
 

<strong>Organs</strong>

Organs are more complex units than tissues.
 An organ is an organization of several different kinds of tissues so arranged
 that together they can perform a special function.
 For example, the stomach is an organization of muscle,
 connective, epithelial, and nervous tissues. 
 Muscle and connective tissues form its wall,
 epithelial and connective tissues form its lining, 
 and nervous tissue extends throughout both its wall and its lining.
