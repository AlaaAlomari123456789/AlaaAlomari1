    <h1>The Intestine</h1>

    <h2>How does the intestine work?</h2>
    <p>
      The intestine (bowel) is a winding muscular tube extending from the stomach to the anus.
      Its main purpose is to digest food, but it also produces substances that send signals to other parts of the body,
      helps fight germs, and regulates water balance. The intestine contains many nerve cells, which explains why stress
      or emotions can cause stomach aches, diarrhea, or constipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small intestine, directly connected to the stomach, is 3–5 meters long and divided into the duodenum,
      jejunum, and ileum. Its folded walls increase surface area for absorption.
    </p>

    <h2>The Small Intestine</h2>
    <p>
      In the small intestine, enzymes break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into their building blocks.
      Intestinal cells absorb these nutrients along with vitamins, salts, and water into the bloodstream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cells also produce hormones that regulate bile and pancreatic juice production, water release into the
      intestine, and feelings of fullness.
    </p>

    <h2>The Large Intestine</h2>
    <p>
      The large intestine (1–1.5 meters long) includes the cecum, appendix, colon, and rectum.
      Strong wave-like movements push stool toward the anus. The rectum stores stool if the urge to defecate is
      suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bowel movement frequency varies from three times a day to three times a week, depending on diet.
      The large intestine also absorbs water and salts, and its bacteria produce vitamins B and K.
