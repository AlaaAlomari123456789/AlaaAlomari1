  <p>
    The liver is an organ about the size of a football. It sits just under your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen.
    The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances.
  </p>
  <p>
    Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). Liver problems can also be caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver,
    such as viruses, alcohol use and obesity. Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring (cirrhosis),
    which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition. But early treatment may give the liver time to heal.
