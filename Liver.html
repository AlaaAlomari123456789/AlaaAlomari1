<h1>The Liver</h1>
<img src="img/angiosarcoma.jpg" alt="The Liver" >
<p>The liver is an organ about the size of a football.
 It sits just under your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen. 
 The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances.
 

Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). 
Liver problems can also be caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver,
 such as viruses, alcohol use and obesity.

Over time, conditions that damage the liver can lead to scarring (cirrhosis), 
which can lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition.
But early treatment may give the liver time to heal.
<h2>Symptoms
Liver problems</h2><p>
Liver problems that can occur include fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. 
The liver and its cells — as seen through a microscope — change dramatically 
when a normal liver becomes fatty or cirrhotic.

Liver disease doesn't always cause noticeable signs and symptoms. 
If signs and symptoms of liver disease do occur, they may include:

Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice)
Abdominal pain and swelling
Swelling in the legs and ankles
Itchy skin
Dark urine color
Pale stool color
Chronic fatigue
Nausea or vomiting
Loss of appetite
Tendency to bruise easily</p>
<h2>When to see a doctor</h2><p>
Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you.
 Seek immediate medical attention if you have abdominal pain that is so severe that you can't stay still.

<h2>Causes</h2>
Liver disease has many causes.

<h2>Infection</h2><p>
Parasites and viruses can infect the liver, causing inflammation that reduces liver function. 
The viruses that cause liver damage can be spread through blood or semen, contaminated food or water,
 or close contact with a person who is infected. 
 The most common types of liver infection are hepatitis viruses, including:

Hepatitis A
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis C</p>
<h2>Immune system abnormality</h2><p>
Diseases in which your immune system attacks certain parts of your body
(autoimmune) can affect your liver. 
Examples of autoimmune liver diseases include:

Autoimmune hepatitis
Primary biliary cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis.</p>
<h2>Genetics</h2><p>
An abnormal gene inherited from one or both of your parents
 can cause various substances to build up in your liver, 
 resulting in liver damage. Genetic liver diseases include:

Hemochromatosis
Wilson's disease
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</p>
<h2>Cancer and other growths</h2><p>
Examples include:

Liver cancer
Bile duct cancer
Liver adenoma</p>
<h2>Other</h2><p>
Additional, common causes of liver disease include:

Chronic alcohol abuse
Fat accumulation in the liver (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease)
Certain prescription or over-the-counter medications
Certain herbal compounds</p>
<h2>Risk factors</h2><p>
Factors that may increase your risk of liver disease include:

Heavy alcohol use
Obesity
Type 2 diabetes
Tattoos or body piercings
Injecting drugs using shared needles
Blood transfusion before 1992
Exposure to other people's blood and body fluids
Unprotected sex
Exposure to certain chemicals or toxins
Family history of liver disease</p>
<h2>Complications</h2><p>
Complications of liver disease vary, depending on the cause of your liver problems.
Untreated liver disease may progress to liver failure, a life-threatening condition.</p>
<h2>Prevention</h2><p>
To prevent liver disease:

Drink alcohol in moderation.
For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
Heavy or high-risk drinking is defined as more than
 eight drinks a week for women and more than 15 drinks a week for men.
Avoid risky behavior. Use a condom during sex. 
If you choose to have tattoos or body piercings,
 be picky about cleanliness and safety when selecting a shop.
 Seek help if you use illicit intravenous drugs, 
 and don't share needles to inject drugs.
Get vaccinated. If you're at increased risk 
of contracting hepatitis or if you've already been infected 
with any form of the hepatitis virus, talk to your doctor 
about getting the hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines.
Use medications wisely. Take prescription and nonprescription 
drugs only when needed and only in recommended doses. 
Don't mix medications and alcohol. 
Talk to your doctor before mixing herbal supplements or prescription or nonprescription drugs.
Avoid contact with other people's blood and body fluids.
 Hepatitis viruses can be spread by accidental needle sticks 
 or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids.
Keep your food safe. Wash your hands thoroughly before eating 
or preparing foods. If traveling in a developing country,
 use bottled water to drink, wash your hands and brush your teeth.
Take care with aerosol sprays. Make sure to use these products 
in a well-ventilated area, and wear a mask when spraying insecticides,
 fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals.
 Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.
Protect your skin. When using insecticides and other toxic chemicals,
 wear gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask so that chemicals aren't absorbed through your skin.
Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
