    <h1>The Thyroid</h1>
    <img src="img/zx.jpg" alt="The Thyroid">

    <p>Your thyroid is an important endocrine gland that makes and releases certain hormones.
      Your thyroid's main job is to control your metabolism — how your body uses energy.
      Sometimes, your thyroid doesn’t work properly. These conditions are common and treatable.</p>

    <h2>Overview – What is the thyroid?</h2>
    <img src="img/nm.jpg" alt="The Thyroid">

    <p>Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of your neck under your skin.
      It’s part of your endocrine system and controls many important functions by producing and releasing hormones.
      Its main job is to control the speed of your metabolism (metabolic rate), which transforms food into energy.</p>

    <h2>What is the endocrine system?</h2>
    <p>Your endocrine system is a network of glands that create and release hormones directly into the bloodstream.
      Hormones are chemical messengers that coordinate body functions. The endocrine system includes:
      Hypothalamus, pituitary gland, thyroid, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, pineal gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes.</p>

    <h2>Function – What does my thyroid do?</h2>
    <p>Your thyroid produces and releases the following hormones:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thyroxine (T4)</strong> – the main hormone, later converted to T3.</li>
      <li><strong>Triiodothyronine (T3)</strong> – more active in controlling metabolism.</li>
      <li><strong>Reverse T3 (RT3)</strong> – reverses the effects of T3.</li>
      <li><strong>Calcitonin</strong> – helps regulate calcium in the blood.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What other organs and glands interact with the thyroid?</h2>
    <p>The thyroid works closely with the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which regulate thyroid hormone levels.
      Thyroid hormones affect many systems: cardiovascular (heart rate, cardiac output), nervous system (mood, sensation),
      digestive system (motility), and reproductive system (fertility, menstruation).</p>

    <h2>Can a person live without a thyroid?</h2>
    <p>Yes, but they must take hormone replacement medication for life after thyroid removal (thyroidectomy).</p>

    <h2>Anatomy – Where is the thyroid located?</h2>
    <p>The thyroid is located at the front of your neck, straddling your trachea.
      It’s butterfly-shaped, with two lobes connected by the thyroid isthmus.</p>

    <h2>How big is the thyroid?</h2>
    <p>About 2 inches long. Usually not visible or palpable unless enlarged (goiter).</p>

    <h2>Conditions and Disorders</h2>
    <p>Common thyroid disorders include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong> – underactive thyroid (causes: Hashimoto’s, iodine deficiency, thyroiditis).</li>
      <li><strong>Hyperthyroidism</strong> – overactive thyroid (causes: Graves’ disease, nodules, excess iodine).</li>
      <li><strong>Goiter</strong> – enlarged thyroid (simple, endemic, sporadic types).</li>
      <li><strong>Thyroid cancer</strong> – papillary, follicular, medullary, anaplastic types.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Symptoms of thyroid problems</h2>
    <p>May include: weight changes, slow/fast heart rate, heat/cold intolerance, depression, anxiety, menstrual changes.</p>

    <h2>How are thyroid conditions treated?</h2>
    <p>Treatment options include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Medications (antithyroid, beta-blockers, hormone replacement).</li>
      <li>Surgery (thyroidectomy, lobectomy).</li>
      <li>Radioactive iodine, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy (for cancer).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Care – How can I keep my thyroid healthy?</h2>
    <p>Ensure enough iodine intake through diet (iodized salt, dairy, seafood, seaweed).
      Avoid excess iodine. Maintain regular checkups with your healthcare provider.</p>

    <h2>When should I call my doctor?</h2>
    <p>If you notice symptoms like unexplained weight changes, heart rate issues, or temperature sensitivity,
      consult your doctor. A simple blood test can check thyroid function.</p>

    <p><strong>A note from Cleveland Clinic:</strong> Thyroid disease is common but treatable.
      If you suspect thyroid problems, talk to your healthcare provider.</p>
